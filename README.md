# Introduction to NodeJS and Express.js

## Description:

In this week, you will delve into backend development using server-side scripting with Node.js and Express.js. You will set up a basic Express.js server and create API endpoints for user authentication, expense management, and expense calculations. This will provide hands-on experience with backend development, API design, and routing using Express.js.

## Documentation

Expense Tracking API created with NodeJS + Express !  
I used Postgres for my database and interected with it using 'pg'.

The API implements security best practices for user authentication (e.g., password hashing, JWT).  
It Validates user input and sanitize data to prevent common security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection).  
It has secure sensitive data and API endpoints using authentication and authorization mechanisms.
